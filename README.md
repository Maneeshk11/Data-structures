# Data-structures

DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED IN C++.

Each folder has the following files:
* FILENAME.h : The data-structure definitions, methods, variables are defined here.
* FILENAME.hpp : The implementations of different methods, functions defined in FILENAME.h are present in this file.
* main.cpp : This particular file contains an example code of implementations of data-structure/algorithm. Feel free to change it and add your own code :).
* Makefile : This file is responsible to link all the files together to form a single output file.
